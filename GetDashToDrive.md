Being the behind-the-scenes guy at *DASH: Detailed*, I do my best to inform folks about Dash. At least in person, such conversations are often kicked-off when someone inquires about how I spend my time. Or what my "Dash" t-shirt references.

I tend to start pretty broad, with what I hope is an accessible, non-jargon-filled overview of cryptocurrency. 

After a bit of discourse the other party often expresses affinity for this paradigm-shifting tool. Especially as I almost never fail to highlight the fact that use of cryptocurrencies like Dash means a move away from federal reserve notes, and all the negative things that that monopolistic currency entails. Also, that "being your own bank" through the use of cryptos fosters consensual interactions, which are always a win-win for both parties.

I'm no Amanda B. Johnson, mind you -- I am not a born wordsmith. But I do think it important to inform other individuals about how they can peacefully disempower the institutions they dislike while empowering themselves.

I often give the person a *DASH: Detailed* outreach/business card so that they have a resource to pursue at their own pace. The cards, by the way, were recently redsigned to include a more prominent link to the [Dash YouTube channel](http://youtube.com/dashorg) and a QR code to [Dash School](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiFMZOlhgsYKKOUOVjQjESCXfR1cCYCod), which is an excellent resource for someone new to this space.

At this point, one of the most commonly-asked questions I receive is, how do I get some Dash? 

A good question indeed.

Responses may include mention of a fiat gateway like [Wall of Coins](https://www.wallofcoins.com/) to buy Bitcoin, then using an exchange like [Poloniex](https://www.poloniex.com/) or [Shapeshift](http://shapeshift.io) to trade for Dash. (Come Feburary, Wall of Coins will allow fiat-to-Dash directly.) Or using [Local Bitcoins](http://localbitcoins.com) to meet someone in a nearby coffee shop to exchange your fiat for their Bitcoin, then trading into Dash via an exchange. (Come January [Dashous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaQ1LOpRSW8) will offer the same functionality for in-person Dash trades.) Or, for the really bold entrepenuers, [submitting a proposal to the Dash treasury](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52TzOgq15h8). **But now there's another way to earn Dash: to drive.**

Last Saturday, [Cell 411](http://getcell411.com) -- the smartphone app that facilitates real-time emergency response between friends and family -- added a ridesharing component. And unlike Uber and others, Cell 411's ridesharing supports peer-to-peer negotiation of both price and payment type. They also don't take a cut. And one of the payment types that's defaulted into the app? Cryptocurrency.

If you are willing to transport people in your town and you indicate on your profile that you accept crypto, you may net some passengers who are willing to pay you in crypto, like Dash. Indeed, it seems like [Dash's InstantSend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJx82On8jig) is perfect for this application, what with it allowing one-second transaction confirmations.

Admittedly, while the proliferation of crypto has yet to reach widescale adoption, it is without question that daily in the USSA, millions hail taxis or use their Uber or Lyft app to get carted across town. Will the peer-powered ridesharing offered via [Cell 411 app](http://getcell411.com) coupled with the nearly-instanteous transactions of Dash help change that?
