# Dash Community Blog

There's a new blog in town!  Anyone is welcome to create a blog post, simply follow the updated [guide for creating a post](https://github.com/dashcommunity/guides/blob/master/create_blog_post.md).  If people are interested, I can make this process much easier by creating a little web application to guide you through the process.  For now we'll do things manually.  

Our blog is now powered by the powerful [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby) static site generator. Gatsby Transforms plain text into dynamic blogs and websites using the latest web technologies, including React.js and Webpack.  The **key benefit** (over simply getting a Medium account, for example) is that *our blog is fully customizable*.  

If you have improvement suggestions, please let me know by either saying something in the `#community` channel of the *Dash Nation* chat, or better yet, by [opening an issue](https://github.com/dashcommunity/blog/issues) in the GitHub repository.
