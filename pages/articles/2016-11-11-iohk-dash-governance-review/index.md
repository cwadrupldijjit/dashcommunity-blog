Charles Hoskinson and the *Veritas Team* of *Input Output HK* have released a research report entitled ***Dash Governance System: Analysis and Suggestions for Improvement***.

##### Abstract

The abstract of the report reads as follows:

> This report contains the intermediate results of an analysis of the Dash Governance System, which is a
blockchain-based means for self-funding the development and advancement of the cryptocurrency Dash.
During this review, weaknesses, both from an architectural and implementation point of view, were
discovered. Presented are possible improvements as well as development proposals, which include
descriptive sketches as a preliminary step towards full formal analysis. The report also analyzes the ties
between the funding in the Dash Governance System and Dash's founders/developers, as well as future
funding directions. The analysis of the Dash Governance System is presented as an initial overview of
DAO's and other self-governing systems for cryptocurrencies, in the spirit of both improving Dash as well
as all cryptocurrencies. While the report provides a basic outline of Dash, some knowledge of
cryptocurrencies and Dash is necessary for a complete understanding of the findings of this report (see,
for example, the Dash whitepaper). The research was performed using the source code v0.12.1, which is
currently deployed in TestNet (the current version in production is v0.12.0).
