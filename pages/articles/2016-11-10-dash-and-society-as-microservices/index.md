There is a good chance that you, dear reader, are not a software architect, so the term [microservice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices), heck, even [Dash](https://www.dash.org) may not mean much to you. Keep reading and I will explain these terms and why they matter.

In the software world, applications have a tendency to morph into monstrosities that look nothing like the initial vision, and one of many available methods to tame said monstrosities is Service-Oriented Architecture. This simply means that the application is divided into logically self-contained sections. Microservices, if you will.

"_Big whoop,_" you're probably thinking. "_How does this apply to Dash?_"

Dash can be considered a microservice focused on currency - one of the many services that the government currently provides. You see, the government is analogous to a monstrous application, a tangled mess of laws and policies that try to control everything, but does so in a way that is [increasingly ineffective](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/society-is-too-complicated-to-have-a-president-complex-mathematics-suggest). With the microservices concept, we break off a piece of logically autonomous functionality and subject it to innovation and competition while minimizing disruption to other services. We achieve technological heterogeneity, which is why Dash is already a superior currency to the Dollar, and how it has been able to leap-frog Bitcoin's initial successes in a short amount of time.

Dash is not only rocketing to the top of the crypto-currency pile due to its privacy features and speed but is also helping redefine the way we think about government and society, even if it is subconscious. The future is micro, and Dash is gonna' be YUGE!
