There's a new blog in town!  Anyone is welcome to create a blog post, simply follow the updated [guide for creating a post](https://github.com/dashcommunity/guides/blob/master/create_blog_post.md).  I will improve this process by creating a *compose* page to for writers to compose a formatted entry without needing to use markdown syntax directly.

Our blog is created using the powerful [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby) static site generator. Gatsby Transforms plain text into dynamic blogs and websites using the latest web technologies, including React.js and Webpack.  The **key benefit** (over simply getting a Medium account, for example) is that *our blog is fully customizable*.  We own and host the data ourselves, independent from a blogging platform (in the spirit of Dash, where ownership is a matter of possession).

If you have suggestions for improvements, please let me know by either saying something in the `#community` channel of the *Dash Nation* Slack, or better yet, by [opening an issue](https://github.com/dashcommunity/blog/issues) in the GitHub repository.
