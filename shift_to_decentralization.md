# The Shift to Decentralization - How and Why

Rough ideas, to be refined later...

Dash is centralized.  Contrary to popular belief, every cryptocurrency starts out centralized.  Satoshi's project started as such, Evan's subsequent improvements started out as such, and indeed, every innovation starts out as such.  An original idea begins centralized by definition; the *origin*al idea has just that, an *origin*, a center.  From that beginning an idea or project may either *remain* centralized, or *become* decentralized.  

A preference and respect for decentralization cannot be taken for granted as the motivating factor for all who take interest in cryptocurrencies.  The libertarian roots of such projects have grown, and are already yielding fruit. Adherants of *many* ideologies now find these projects favorable.  

In order to assure sustainable growth, the fundamental principles that have made cryptocurrencies successful must be consciously protected.  This requires a shift from a centralized idea to a decentralized, community-driven collaborative project.  

It must also be emphasized that centralization is not necessarily bad.  Centralized projects, in their incubation, can move efficiently because there is a simple governance model and pure ideas can be developed without excessive community deliberation.  They can also offer healthy financial incentives for early founding members to push through difficult start up challenges.

However, to gain sustainable widespread adoption and resilience to outside attacks and competition, centralization and hierarchical governance must yield to decentralization and distributed, networked governance.  Getting people to build their ideas and projects on top of yours requires an explicit welcome to community collaboration and low barriers in making such connections...

At this moment, most of the most important code comes straight out of the main developers. These people are paid from the budget system, but they are currently quite centralized. Even thought they are getting paid in creative ways, (go dash!), say Evan stops working for us, further development would be halted for some time. 

Creating an idea is often learned best from looking at the past. We can look at past cryptocurrency, and see how some are successful and some weren't so. ***show some example with a nice table***

Bitcoin has many librarys for ported over code and API's for multiple languages. This is exactly what we are talking about. None of this actually came from one source. Another example is the multiple of mobile and computer wallets available. Right now, the only wallets have that haven't came directly from the main "dev team" is the Jaxx wallet. Sadly they are having problems adding it back to the Apple App Store. ####, the lead of advertising and adoption is currently helping with this big problem. 


This is one incentive for "Dash Community". Putting resources all in one space, while providing some level of organization and welcomeness. For example, we can encourage projects, code and blogs/articles that will make people feel incentified for helping out. This is a great way to utilize the budget system as it will pay people in a *decentralized* well and hopefully feed more creativity and encouragement... ###
